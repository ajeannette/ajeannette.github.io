# A. Jeannette's Github Playground

Hello and welcome to my fun playground Github repository dedicated solely to practicing making super cute and pretty webpages!

## Goals:
- Developing neat and fun webpage features that are, primarily, cute
- Learning how to create effective webpages that highlight subject matter in a sophisticated and engaging way
- Collecting and experimenting with beautiful fonts, images, and other media features that might be useful in future projects

## Let's do this!
